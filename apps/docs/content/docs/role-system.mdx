description: Implement Role System in Fuma Comment
---

## Introduction

It's common to have roles like moderators in a comment area.
Fuma comment supports Role System based on your database and the Auth Provider (e.g. Clerk).

### Database

In the Fuma Comment function, set the `role` option to `database`.

For example, on Next.js:

```ts title="app/api/comments/[[...comment]]/route.ts"
import { NextComment } from "@fuma-comment/next";

export const { GET, DELETE, PATCH, POST } = NextComment({
  role: "database",
  // other options
});
```

Fuma Comment will now fetch the role information of users and use it to determine their permissions.
To give roles to a user, add new records to the `Role` table.

### Auth Provider

Some Auth providers like Clerk has native support for Role system.

You can define a custom function to fetch user info alone with their role information.

```ts title="app/api/comments/[[...comment]]/route.ts"
import { NextComment } from "@fuma-comment/next";

export const { GET, DELETE, PATCH, POST } = NextComment({
  role: "auth",
  async getSessionWithRole(req, { page }) {
    // ...
  },
  // other options
});
```
