title: Clerk Auth
description: Use Clerk as your auth provider
---

## Setup

Create the adapter, and pass it to your storage's `auth` option, so that it can access the user profiles.

```ts title="comment.config.ts"
import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
import { ClerkAdapter } from "@fuma-comment/server/adapters/clerk";
// ORM adapter:
import { db } from "./database";
import { createDrizzleAdapter } from "@fuma-comment/server/adapters/drizzle";
import { comments, rates, roles } from "@/lib/schema";

// pass a function that can obtain the auth object, e.g. `auth()` on Next.js
export const clerkAdapter = ClerkAdapter(() => auth());

export const storage = createDrizzleAdapter({
  db,
  schemas: {
    comments,
    rates,
    roles,
  },
  auth: clerkAdapter,
});
```

And update your route config:

```ts title="app/api/comments/[[...comment]]/route.ts"
import { NextComment } from "@fuma-comment/server/next";
import { clerkAdapter, storage } from "@/lib/comment.config";

export const { GET, DELETE, PATCH, POST } = NextComment({
  // import from comment.config.ts
  auth: clerkAdapter,
  storage,
});
```
