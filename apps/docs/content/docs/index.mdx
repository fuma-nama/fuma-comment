import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

A beautiful, yet simple library that brings a comment area into your blog.

Note that it is not a SaaS, you will need a database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) to continue.

## Client

Currently, we provide a React.js client API.

```tsx
'use client'
import { signIn } from "next-auth/react";
import { Comments } from "@fuma-comment/react";

export function CommentsWithAuth() {
  return (
    <Comments
      auth={{
        type: 'api',
        // function to sign in
        signIn: () => void signIn("github"),
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

Fuma Comment doesn't force an Auth system on your app, you can use your own Auth system, like integrating with BetterAuth.

By default, it calls an API endpoint to get authentication data, you will need to provide a `signIn` function for user to sign in.

### Styling

All components are pre-styled with Tailwind CSS, notice that it also normalizes your CSS ([Preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight)).

```ts
import "@fuma-comment/react/style.css";
```

For projects using Tailwind CSS v4, use the Tailwind CSS preset instead:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@fuma-comment/react/preset.css";

/* path of the package relative to the CSS file */
@source '../node_modules/@fuma-comment/react/dist/**/*.js';
```

## Database

You need a database to persist comments.

Fuma Comment has built-in support for multiple ORMs, you can copy the required schemas:

<Tabs items={["Drizzle", "Prisma"]}>

<Tab title="Drizzle">

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "../../packages/server/src/db/schema.drizzle.ts",
  "codeblock": {
    "lang": "ts",
    "meta": "title=\"lib/schema.ts\""
  }
}
```

```ts title="lib/comment.config.ts"
import { createDrizzleAdapter } from "@fuma-comment/server/adapters/drizzle";
import { comments, rates, roles, user } from "@/lib/schema";

const storage = createDrizzleAdapter({
  db,
  schemas: {
    comments,
    rates,
    roles,
    user,
  },
  // Use tables created by your auth provider
  auth: 'next-auth' | 'better-auth',
})
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Prisma">

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "../../packages/server/src/db/schema.prisma",
  "codeblock": {
    "lang": "prisma",
    "meta": "title=\"schema.prisma\""
  }
}
```

```ts title="lib/comment.config.ts"
import { createPrismaAdapter } from "@fuma-comment/server/adapters/prisma";

const storage = createPrismaAdapter({
  db: prisma,
  // Use tables created by your auth provider
  auth: 'next-auth' | 'better-auth',
})
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Other Adapters

you may implement your own storage adapter following the instructions in TSDoc of `StorageAdapter`.

## Auth Provider

Fuma Comment supports multiple auth providers, you can choose one of them:

### NextAuth

```ts title="lib/comment.config.ts"
import { createNextAuthAdapter } from "@fuma-comment/server/adapters/next-auth";
// Next Auth options
import { authOptions } from "@/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/options";

const auth = createNextAuthAdapter(authOptions)
```

### BetterAuth

```ts title="lib/comment.config.ts"
import { createBetterAuthAdapter } from "@fuma-comment/server/adapters/better-auth";
import { auth as betterAuth } from "@/lib/auth";

const auth = createBetterAuthAdapter(betterAuth)
```

## Server

Fuma Comment supports several web/backend frameworks, including Next.js and Express.

### Next.js

Create `app/api/comments/[[...comment]]/route.ts`.

```ts title="app/api/comments/[[...comment]]/route.ts"
import { NextComment } from "@fuma-comment/next";

export const { GET, DELETE, PATCH, POST } = NextComment({
  // import from comment.config.ts
  auth,
  storage,
});
```

### Express

Pass your express app as a parameter, all the endpoints will be added under `/api/comments`.

```ts
import { ExpressComment } from "@fuma-comment/server/express";

ExpressComment({
  // your app
  app,
  // import from comment.config.ts
  auth
  storage
});
```

## Done!

You can now have fun with Fuma Comment!
